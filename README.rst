A socket mock framework
-------------------------
    for all kinds of socket *animals*, web-clients included - with gevent/asyncio/SSL support

...and then MicroPython's *urequests* (*mocket >= 3.9.1*)

What is it about?
=================

In a nutshell, **Mocket** is *monkey-patching on steroids* for the ``socket`` and ``ssl`` modules.

It’s designed to serve two main purposes:

- As a **low-level framework** — for example, if you're building a client for a new database or protocol.
- As a **ready-to-use mock** — perfect for testing HTTP or HTTPS calls from any client library.

To demonstrate that Mocket is more than just a web client mocking tool, it even includes a simple Redis mock.

The main goal of Mocket is to make it easier to test Python clients that communicate using the ``socket`` protocol.

Outside GitHub
==============

Mocket packages are available for `openSUSE`_, `NixOS`_, `ALT Linux`_, `NetBSD`_, and of course from `PyPI`_.

.. _`openSUSE`: https://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&q=mocket
.. _`NixOS`: https://search.nixos.org/packages?query=mocket
.. _`ALT Linux`: https://packages.altlinux.org/en/sisyphus/srpms/python3-module-mocket/
.. _`NetBSD`: https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/devel/py-mocket/index.html
.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project/mocket/


Versioning
==========
Starting from *3.7.0*, Mocket major version will follow the same numbering pattern as Python's and therefore indicate the most recent Python version that is supported.

FYI: the last version compatible with Python 2.7 is *3.9.4*, bugfixing or backporting of features introduced after that release will only be available as commercial support.

How to use it
=============
Read the following blog posts if you want to have a big picture of what *Mocket* is capable of:

- https://medium.com/p/mocket-is-alive-and-is-fighting-with-us-b2810d52597a
- https://hackernoon.com/make-development-great-again-faab769d264e
- https://hackernoon.com/httpretty-now-supports-asyncio-e310814704c6
- https://medium.com/@mindflayer/how-to-make-your-tests-fail-when-they-try-to-access-the-network-python-eb80090a6d24
- https://medium.com/@mindflayer/testing-in-an-asyncio-world-a9a0ad41b0c5

The starting point to understand how to use *Mocket* to write a custom mock is the following example:

- https://github.com/mindflayer/mocketoy

As next step, you are invited to have a look at the implementation of both the mocks it provides:

- HTTP mock (similar to HTTPretty) - https://github.com/mindflayer/python-mocket/blob/main/mocket/mocks/mockhttp.py
- Redis mock (basic implementation) - https://github.com/mindflayer/python-mocket/blob/main/mocket/mocks/mockredis.py

Please also have a look at the huge test suite:

- Tests module at https://github.com/mindflayer/python-mocket/tree/main/tests

Installation
============
Using pip::

    $ pip install mocket

Speedups
========
Mocket uses **xxhash** when available instead of *hashlib.md5* for creating hashes, you can install it as follows::

    $ pip install mocket[speedups]

Issues
============
When opening an **Issue**, please add few lines of code as failing test, or -better- open its relative **Pull request** adding this test to our test suite.

Example of how to mock an HTTP[S] call
======================================
Let's create a new virtualenv with all we need::

    $ python3 -m venv example
    $ source example/bin/activate
    $ pip install pytest requests mocket

As second step, we create an `example.py` file as the following one:

.. code-block:: python

    import json

    from mocket import mocketize
    from mocket.mocks.mockhttp import Entry
    import requests
    import pytest


    @pytest.fixture
    def response():
        return {
            "integer": 1,
            "string": "asd",
            "boolean": False,
        }


    @mocketize  # use its decorator
    def test_json(response):
        url_to_mock = 'https://testme.org/json'

        Entry.single_register(
            Entry.GET,
            url_to_mock,
            body=json.dumps(response),
            headers={'content-type': 'application/json'}
        )

        mocked_response = requests.get(url_to_mock).json()

        assert response == mocked_response

    # OR use its context manager
    from mocket import Mocketizer

    def test_json_with_context_manager(response):
        url_to_mock = 'https://testme.org/json'

        Entry.single_register(
            Entry.GET,
            url_to_mock,
            body=json.dumps(response),
            headers={'content-type': 'application/json'}
        )

        with Mocketizer():
            mocked_response = requests.get(url_to_mock).json()

        assert response == mocked_response

Let's fire our example test::

    $ py.test example.py

How to make Mocket fail when it tries to write to a real `socket`?
==================================================================
NEW!!! Sometimes you just want your tests to fail when they attempt to use the network.

.. code-block:: python

    with Mocketizer(strict_mode=True):
        with pytest.raises(StrictMocketException):
            requests.get("https://duckduckgo.com/")

    # OR

    @mocketize(strict_mode=True)
    def test_get():
        with pytest.raises(StrictMocketException):
            requests.get("https://duckduckgo.com/")

You can specify exceptions as a list of hosts or host-port pairs.

.. code-block:: python

    with Mocketizer(strict_mode=True, strict_mode_allowed=["localhost", ("intake.ourmetrics.net", 443)]):
        ...

    # OR

    @mocketize(strict_mode=True, strict_mode_allowed=["localhost", ("intake.ourmetrics.net", 443)])
    def test_get():
        ...


How to be sure that all the Entry instances have been served?
=============================================================
Add this instruction at the end of the test execution:

.. code-block:: python

    Mocket.assert_fail_if_entries_not_served()

Example of how to fake socket errors
====================================

It's very important that we test non-happy paths.

.. code-block:: python

    @mocketize
    def test_raise_exception(self):
        url = "http://github.com/fluidicon.png"
        Entry.single_register(Entry.GET, url, exception=socket.error())
        with self.assertRaises(requests.exceptions.ConnectionError):
            requests.get(url)

Example of how to mock a call with a custom `can_handle` function
=================================================================
.. code-block:: python

    import json

    from mocket import mocketize
    from mocket.mocks.mockhttp import Entry
    import requests

    @mocketize
    def test_can_handle():
        Entry.single_register(
            Entry.GET,
            url,
            body=json.dumps({"message": "Nope... not this time!"}),
            headers={"content-type": "application/json"},
            can_handle_fun=lambda path, qs_dict: path == "/ip" and qs_dict,
        )
        Entry.single_register(
            Entry.GET,
            url,
            body=json.dumps({"message": "There you go!"}),
            headers={"content-type": "application/json"},
            can_handle_fun=lambda path, qs_dict: path == "/ip" and not qs_dict,
        )
        resp = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/ip")
        assert resp.status_code == 200
        assert resp.json() == {"message": "There you go!"}


Example of how to record real socket traffic
============================================

You probably know what *VCRpy* is capable of, that's the *mocket*'s way of achieving it:

.. code-block:: python

    @mocketize(truesocket_recording_dir=tempfile.mkdtemp())
    def test_truesendall_with_recording_https():
        url = 'https://httpbin.org/ip'

        requests.get(url, headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
        resp = requests.get(url, headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
        assert resp.status_code == 200

        dump_filename = os.path.join(
            Mocket.get_truesocket_recording_dir(),
            Mocket.get_namespace() + '.json',
        )
        with io.open(dump_filename) as f:
            response = json.load(f)

        assert len(response['httpbin.org']['443'].keys()) == 1

HTTPretty compatibility layer
=============================
Mocket HTTP mock can work as *HTTPretty* replacement for many different use cases. Two main features are missing, or better said, are implemented differently:

- URL entries containing regular expressions, *Mocket* implements `can_handle_fun` which is way simpler to use and more powerful;
- response body from functions (used mostly to fake errors, *Mocket* accepts an `exception` instead).

Both features are documented above.

Two features which are against the Zen of Python, at least imho (*mindflayer*), but of course I am open to call it into question.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    import json

    import aiohttp
    import asyncio
    from unittest import TestCase

    from mocket.plugins.httpretty import httpretty, httprettified


    class AioHttpEntryTestCase(TestCase):
        @httprettified
        def test_https_session(self):
            url = 'https://httpbin.org/ip'
            httpretty.register_uri(
                httpretty.GET,
                url,
                body=json.dumps(dict(origin='127.0.0.1')),
            )

            async def main(l):
                async with aiohttp.ClientSession(
                    loop=l, timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=3)
                ) as session:
                    async with session.get(url) as get_response:
                        assert get_response.status == 200
                        assert await get_response.text() == '{"origin": "127.0.0.1"}'

            loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
            loop.set_debug(True)
            loop.run_until_complete(main(loop))

What about the other socket animals?
====================================
Using *Mocket* with asyncio based clients::

    $ pip install aiohttp

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # `aiohttp` creates SSLContext instances at import-time
    # that's why Mocket would get stuck when dealing with HTTP
    # Importing the module while Mocket is in control (inside a
    # decorated test function or using its context manager would
    # be enough for making it work), the alternative is using a
    # custom TCPConnector which always return a FakeSSLContext
    # from Mocket like this example is showing.
    import aiohttp
    import pytest

    from mocket import async_mocketize
    from mocket.mocks.mockhttp import Entry
    from mocket.plugins.aiohttp_connector import MocketTCPConnector


    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    @async_mocketize
    async def test_aiohttp():
        """
        The alternative to using the custom `connector` would be importing
        `aiohttp` when Mocket is already in control (inside the decorated test).
        """

        url = "https://bar.foo/"
        data = {"message": "Hello"}

        Entry.single_register(
	    Entry.GET,
	    url,
	    body=json.dumps(data),
	    headers={"content-type": "application/json"},
        )

        async with aiohttp.ClientSession(
	    timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=3), connector=MocketTCPConnector()
        ) as session, session.get(url) as response:
	    response = await response.json()
	    assert response == data


Works well with others
=======================
Using *Mocket* as pook_ engine::

    $ pip install mocket[pook]

.. _pook: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pook

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    import pook
    from mocket.plugins.pook_mock_engine import MocketEngine

    pook.set_mock_engine(MocketEngine)

    pook.on()

    url = 'http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar'
    status = 404
    response_json = {'error': 'foo'}

    mock = pook.get(
        url,
        headers={'content-type': 'application/json'},
        reply=status,
        response_json=response_json,
    )
    mock.persist()

    requests.get(url)
    assert mock.calls == 1

    resp = requests.get(url)
    assert resp.status_code == status
    assert resp.json() == response_json
    assert mock.calls == 2
